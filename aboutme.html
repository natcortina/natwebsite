   <p>Dear human, happy you made it here ! </p>
   
   <p> Born and raised in Mexico City, I am a designer focused on creative technology
     based in Manhattan NY. I am very curious and growth-oriented, a people person for sure, 
     really good communicator and someone who likes a dynamic and fast paced work environment (I am an Aries).  </p>
    
    <p>  My main focus in my projects/designs/animations are mindfullness, self-love, and everyday experiences. </p>
   <p> I would like further in my projects, to keep mixing the serious with comedy.  
    so taboo or complex topics can be approached and understood by people more easily. </p>

   <p>  I love to take a surrealist approach, as well as a minimalistic and "homemade" aesthetic. </p> 
   
   <p>I want people to feel at ease, understood and warped around what I do, 
    for people to be safe and listened, and for my designs to speak for things 
    that people struggle to talk about.  </p>
